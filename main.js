The building - through its shape, physiology and vertical extends - is seen as a climatic apparatus, a breathing device, providing a new public space underground, where temperatures remain stable throughout the year. The proposed builing becomes a vessel of an expanding urban lung. - An urban strategy for reducing the urban heat islands, while offering an unsealed ground for interspecies habitat and a public space for comfort and culture.",

The weave is a starting technique, which creates a base structure for the substrate and the seeds (or mycelium) to be combined. Through time and the process of self-feeding, the roots grow stronger and reinforce the woven network. These structural elements in becoming, initially serve as green habitats and flood absorbents while transforming into a source of material for a new urban fabric.",

In this case, it is the matter of an abandoned construct in the north of the Adriatic Sea - coming into being and reawakening after the shutdown of its original function as a gigantic oil rig. There will be a revolutionized station for investigating sea life and to expose its unique environmental changes embedded in a particular setting.",
